# titanic-eda-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to uncover patterns, visualize distributions, and understand feature relationships.

Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships in the data using visualizations and basic statistics. The goal is to understand the structure of the data before applying any machine learning models.

Tools & Libraries
Google Colab – Coding environment

Pandas – For data handling and manipulation

NumPy – For numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For visualizing distributions and relationships

Plotly Express – For interactive graphs

📄 Dataset
File used: Titanic-Dataset (1).csv

Contains passenger details like age, gender, fare, class, and survival status.

🔍 What I Did
Loaded the dataset using file upload in Google Colab.

Checked data structure using .info(), .head(), and .describe().

Identified missing values and planned for cleanup.

Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots for key numeric features (Age, Fare, etc.).

Generated a correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships and dependencies.

📊 Key Learnings
Identified which columns may influence survival (like gender and class).

Learned how to spot outliers and patterns visually.

Understood the importance of correlation before feature selection.

✅ Output
Clean visualizations, summary statistics, and initial feature-level insights for the Titanic dataset — all ready for the next step in the ML pipeline.
